        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <p>A.J. Java was founded in 2003; and has since added a second
        location in 2004. In July 7, 2008 AJ on the Rails, its third and
        location was opened. As a full scale restaurant that provides the
        best in American/Soul Food. This makes three locations in six years.
        And it is all due to the good grace of every customer we serve.</p>

        <p>This place should reflect the rich diversity of the neighborhood
        and nation in which we all live. Home is where everyone knows your
        name (or at least your drink) before you step through the door.</p>
